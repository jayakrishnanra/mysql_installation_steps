FOR MAC ONLY using native packages(using DMG) (As of Feb-2018, High Sierra 10.13.3)

Version 5.7.21
The product documentation is available at https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/osx-installation.html. But following is the gist for MAC users.

1) Download the dmg and install from https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/ . Steps here - https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/osx-installation-pkg.html . This documentation is based on installation for all users. Keep the temporary root password generated by the installer safe.
2) It should create the installation under /usr/local . The soft link /usr/local/mysql points to the actual installation for e.g - /usr/local/mysql-5.7.21-macos10.13-x86_64. Navigate to /usr/local/mysql and check the permissions. 'data' and 'keyring' folders are owned by _mysql(to keep in mind, not relevant for installation).
3) Initialize the data folder. This is done automatically when using DMG and can be skipped. More information here -  https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/postinstallation.html
4) Starting the server - https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/starting-server.html. MySql should be run using an unprovileged account.
sudo mysqld_safe --user=mysql
5) Testing the server  - https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/testing-server.html
The temporary root password needs to be changed.
bin/mysqladmin -u root shutdown
bin/mysqld_safe --user=mysql

The commands can be used along with preference pane.

Use export PATH=${PATH}:/usr/local/mysql/bin/ to configure path.
